LEIB - Ibiza-Eivissa Airport
----------------------------

How to install the scenery?

Copy or unzip all files and put it in the following folder:
Flightgear -> data -> Scenery -> Objects -> e000n30 -> e001n38

Be sure that you replace the stg-file named "2973753" otherwise it won't work later.

Have fun with many flights to Ibiza.
